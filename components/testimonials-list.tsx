She goes above and beyond and her attention to detail is unmatched. Our last project was part of a remodel and addition that we did and she managed all aspects, from wallpaper, flooring to furniture and decor. She is attentive to the needs of the family and to the things that are important to them but is not afraid to push the decorative boundaries to finish the look. Superb professional that you can entrust with your most precious asset!!!",

We are very happy with the work she has done for and with us. Lynne has also brought other expert resources for project work including painters, electricians, tile and countertop craftsman, etc and we have appreciated the quality of their work as well. she has high standards and seems to partner well with those of similar values.
